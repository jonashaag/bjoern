A screamingly fast, ultra-lightweight WSGI_ server for CPython,
written in C using Marc Lehmann's high performance libev_ event loop and
Ryan Dahl's http-parser_.

Why It's Cool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
bjoern is the *fastest*, *smallest* and *most lightweight* WSGI server out there,
featuring

* ~ 1000 lines of C code
* Memory footprint ~ 600KB
* Single-threaded and without coroutines or other crap
* Can bind to TCP `host:port` addresses and Unix sockets (thanks @k3d3!)
* Full persistent connection ("*keep-alive*") support in both HTTP/1.0 and 1.1,
  including support for HTTP/1.1 chunked responses

Why It's Not Cool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Entirely written as a C extension, so portability may be a concern.
* Not HTTP/1.1 capable (yet).


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
``pip install bjoern``. See `wiki <https://github.com/jonashaag/bjoern/wiki/Installation>`_ for details.

Usage
~~~~~
::

   # Bind to TCP host/port pair:
   bjoern.run(wsgi_application, host, port)

   # TCP host/port pair, enabling SO_REUSEPORT if available.
   bjoern.run(wsgi_application, host, port, reuse_port=True)

   # Bind to Unix socket:
   bjoern.run(wsgi_application, 'unix:/path/to/socket')

   # Bind to abstract Unix socket: (Linux only)
   bjoern.run(wsgi_application, 'unix:@socket_name')

Alternatively, the mainloop can be run separately::

   bjoern.listen(wsgi_application, host, port)
   bjoern.run()
   
You can also simply pass a Python socket(-like) object. Note that you are responsible
for initializing and cleaning up the socket in that case. ::

   bjoern.server_run(socket_object, wsgi_application)
   bjoern.server_run(filedescriptor_as_integer, wsgi_application)
