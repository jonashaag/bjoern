bjoern: Fast And Ultra-Lightweight Asynchronous HTTP/1.1 WSGI Server
====================================================================

A screamingly fast, ultra-lightweight asynchronous WSGI_ server for CPython,
written in C using Marc Lehmann's high performance libev_ event loop and
Ryan Dahl's http-parser_.

Why It's Cool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
bjoern is the *fastest*, *smallest* and *most lightweight* WSGI server out there,
featuring

* ~ 1000 lines of C code
* Memory footprint ~ 600KB
* Single-threaded and without coroutines or other crap
* Full persistent connection ("*keep-alive*") support in both HTTP/1.0 and 1.1,
  including support for HTTP/1.1 chunked responses

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
